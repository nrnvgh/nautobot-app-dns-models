# Using the App

This document describes common use-cases and scenarios for this App.

## General Usage

Generally, this App is to used to keep track of DNS Zones and their related data and records. The idea is to have a set of models that can either be used to directly model DNS configurations or as a place to aggregate data about DNS related configuration from other tools. While A, AAAA, and PTR records are already partially supported within Nautobot core models, this App is meant to expand the type of DNS records and formalize DNS models within Nautobot.

## Use-cases and common workflows

Use the API or GUI to add DNS Zones and Record objects to Nautobot.

For rule-driven records, use [Reconciliation jobs](reconciliation_jobs.md) when you need a full rescan—such as after adding rules—or drift repair, instead of relying only on object save signals.
